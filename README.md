# Sugeno-fuzzy-system-trained-on-Diagnostic-Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
This repo contains 2 MATLAB machine learning projects, one using logistic regression and the other one Sugeno fuzzy system. Both are trained and tested on the Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset and their goal is to diagnose if a tumor is malignant or benign.

The fuzzy system outperformed the logistic regression system in every benchmark besides the malignant diagnosis, recall and the training time which was 2.2155 seconds (1.3519 seconds longer). The accuracy of the fuzzy system was higher by 0.8%, the precision was higher by 1.3% and F1 was higher by 0.7% (Actual results: accuracy = 98.2%, recall = 97.4%, precision = 100%, F1 = 98.7%).
